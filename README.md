开放域问答系统旨在通过理解广泛的主题和问题来提供精确的答案，这对提高信息检索的效率和准确性至关重要。然而，当前系统在处理特定领域时面临着数据质量低、个性化需求处理不足以及处理关键医疗信息的敏感度不足的挑战。针对这些挑战，提出了一种结合检索增强生成技术和信息融合方法的新策略，旨在改善开放域问答系统的性能。通过构建一个全面的真实案例数据集，涵盖患者、医院和医生的丰富文本知识库，实现了深度信息融合。利用二次检索技术，系统能够准确地提取和利用与问答任务直接相关的领域知识。此外，采用BART模型，能够利用检索到的信息来生成精确和高度相关的回答。实验结果表明，这种基于信息融合的检索增强生成方法能够显著提高问答系统在处理具体领域问题时的准确率和相关性。与传统的问答系统相比，在个性化咨询处理上展现了更高的敏感性和适应性。生成的答案不仅在内容上更为丰富和准确，而且更能满足用户的具体需求。
Open-domain question-answering systems aim to provide precise answers by understanding a wide range of topics and questions, which is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval. However, current systems face challenges when dealing with specific domains, including low data quality, inadequate handling of personalized requirements, and insufficient sensitivity in processing critical medical information. To address these challenges, a new strategy combining retrieval-augmented generation technology and information fusion methods is proposed, aiming to improve the performance of open-domain question-answering systems. By constructing a comprehensive real-case dataset that covers a rich text knowledge base of patients, hospitals, and doctors, deep information fusion is achieved. Utilizing secondary retrieval techniques, the system can accurately extract and utilize domain knowledge directly relevant to the question-answering task. Moreover, employing the BART model enables the use of retrieved information to generate precise and highly relevant answers. Experimental results demonstrate that this information fusion-based retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly enhances the accuracy and relevance of the question-answering system in dealing with specific domain issues. Compared to traditional systems, it shows higher sensitivity and adaptability in handling personalized consultations. The generated answers are not only richer and more accurate in content but also better meet the specific needs of users.
